# Lily Playground

Where we do android things and experiments

## Main idea

The idea is to learn as we play, using the concepts/libraries/components as we learn about them.

## Organization

This repository will be organized in folders (a folder, a project, an app). We will be experimenting with different Android features so the name of the folders will be relative with the feature that it's played with.
